# LULC-data
Land Cover data – Upper Paraná River Basin (UPRB)

This folder “LULC-data” is composed of Land cover maps UPRB_OBJECT_BASED_1985.tif (UPRB-1985) and UPRB_OBJECT_BASED_2015.tif (UPRB-2015) that were developed, respectively, using satellite data from 1985 and 2015. UPRB_OBJECT_BASED_1985.tif.lyr and UPRB_OBJECT_BASED_2015.tif.lyr are layers in ArcGIS format that can be used for extraction of the color scheme suggested for the classification products. 

The UPRB-1985 used 52 Landsat 5 orthorectified scenes, and the UPRB-2015 data used 50 Landsat 8 orthorectified scenes. In both mappings, the scenes were collected during the dry season in the region, between April to September. The available mappings were developed using the support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier and object-based approaches. Further information about methodology and additional data can be obtained in the manuscripts published at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100436 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2019.101926 

The Classification scheme adopted and the RGB for each Land cover class is provided below:
